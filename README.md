Code for analysis found in Ruffieux & Wettsetin et al., Life years lost associated with mental illness: A cohort study of beneficiaries of a South African medical insurance scheme, *Journal of Affective Disorders*, 2023

*Background:* People with mental illness have a reduced life expectancy, but the extent of the mortality gap and the contribution of natural and unnatural causes to excess mortality among people with mental illness in South Africa are unknown.

*Methods:* We analysed reimbursement claims from South African medical insurance scheme beneficiaries aged 15–85 years. We estimated excess life years lost (LYL) associated with organic, substance use, psychotic, mood, anxiety, eating, personality, developmental or any mental disorders.

*Results:* We followed 1,070,183 beneficiaries for a median of three years, of whom 282,926 (26.4 %) received mental health diagnoses. Men with a mental health diagnosis lost 3.83 life years (95 % CI 3.58–4.10) compared to men without. Women with a mental health diagnosis lost 2.19 life years (1.97–2.41) compared to women without. Excess mortality varied by sex and diagnosis, from 11.50 LYL (95 % CI 9.79–13.07) among men with alcohol use disorder to 0.87 LYL (0.40–1.43) among women with generalised anxiety disorder. Most LYL were attributable to natural causes (men: 3.42, women: 1.94). A considerable number of LYL were attributable to unnatural causes among men with bipolar (1.52) or substance use (2.45) disorder.

*Limitations:* Mental diagnoses are based on reimbursement claims.

*Conclusions:* Premature mortality among South African individuals with mental disorders is high. Our findings support interventions for the prevention, early detection, and treatment of physical comorbidities in this population. Targeted programs for suicide prevention and substance use treatment, particularly among men, can help reduce excess mortality from unnatural causes.
