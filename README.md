Code for analysis of excess mortality associated with mental illness in a South African medical insurance scheme.

**Background** People with mental illness have a reduced life expectancy, but the extent of the mortality gap and the contribution of natural and unnatural causes to excess mortality among people with mental illness in South Africa are unknown. 

**Methods** We analysed reimbursement claims and vital registration data from South African medical insurance scheme beneficiaries aged 15–85 years. We estimated excess life years lost (LYL) associated with organic, substance use, psychotic, mood, anxiety, eating, personality, developmental or any mental disorders.

**Findings** We followed 1 070 183 beneficiaries, of whom 282 926 (26·4%) received mental health diagnoses. Life expectancy of people with mental health diagnoses was 3·83 years (95% CI 3·58–4·10) shorter for men and 2·19 years (1·97–2·41) shorter for women. Excess mortality varied by sex and diagnosis, ranging from 11·50 LYL (95% CI 9·79–13·07) among men with alcohol use disorder to 0·87 LYL (0·40–1·43) among women with generalised anxiety disorder. Most LYL were attributable to natural causes (3·42 among men and 1·94 among women). A considerable number of LYL were attributable to unnatural causes among men with bipolar (1·52) or substance use (2·45) disorder. 

**Interpretation** The burden of premature mortality among persons with mental disorders in South Africa is high. Our findings support implementing interventions for prevention, early detection, and treatment of physical comorbidities among people with mental disorders. Suicide prevention and substance use treatment programmes are needed to reduce excess mortality from unnatural causes, especially among men. 

In additional analyses, we computed adjusted hazard ratios comparing mortality in people with a mental health diagnosis to those without, using Cox proportional hazards models.
